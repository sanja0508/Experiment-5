// Experiment-5

Aim: To study and implement various decision-making statements in C++.

Software Required: Visual Studio

Theory: Decision-making in C++ allows a program to execute specific blocks of code based on given conditions. These are known as conditional or decision-control statements. They are essential for creating programs that respond differently to various inputs or situations.

The common decision-making statements in C++ include:

if Statement Executes a block of code only if the specified condition is true.

if-else Statement Executes one block of code if the condition is true, otherwise executes another block.

if-else-if Ladder Allows checking multiple conditions in sequence. The first true condition's block is executed.

Nested if-else Allows if or else blocks to contain additional if statements, useful for handling complex logic.

switch Statement Used when multiple discrete cases are to be evaluated based on the value of a single variable. It serves as a cleaner alternative to long if-else ladders. Odd-Even Check – Uses if-else to check if a number is divisible by 2.

Implementation

Vowel Check – Uses an if-else-if ladder to check if a character is a vowel or consonant.

Find Largest Number – Uses multiple if conditions to compare three numbers and find the largest.

Basic Calculator – Uses a switch statement to perform arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) based on user choice.

Report Card Viewer – Uses switch to display subject marks based on the user’s menu selection.

Conclusion: These programs demonstrate how various decision-making statements in C++—such as if, if-else, if-else-if, nested if, and switch—can be used to control program flow based on user inputs and conditions. Understanding and implementing these statements is essential for writing logic-driven, interactive applications.
